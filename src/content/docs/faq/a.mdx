### how are we storing the preferences ?

- preferences (selected model id and autocommit) are stored in `git-acm-prefs.json` in your OS config directory.
- cached models are stored in `models.json` in the same directory.

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/git-acm`
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git-acm`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/git-acm`

<FileTree>

- os-config-dir
  - git-acm
    - git-acm-prefs.json don't manually change it
    - models.json don't manually change it
    - ...

</FileTree>
