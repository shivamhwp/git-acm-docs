### how are we storing the preferences ?

- the model pref. is stored in `~/.config/git-acm/model.txt` file. the program reads the file and decides which model to use.
- the autocommit pref. is stored in `~/.config/git-acm/autocommit.txt`. it has two values `enable` or `disable`.

<FileTree>

- .config
  - git-acm
    - model.txt don't manually change it
    - autocommit.txt don't manually change it
    - ...

</FileTree>
