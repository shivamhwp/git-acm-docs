_instant meaningful git commit messages, locally with AI_.

git-acm is a tool that makes writing commit messages in git a breeze. it uses ai to generate meaningful messages based on your code changes, saving you time and ensuring your commit history is clear.

with git-acm, you can focus on coding instead of crafting messages. it supports multiple ai models, so you can pick the one that works best for you. whether you're solo or part of a team, git-acm helps by providing instant, context-aware messages.

in this guide, we'll cover how to install and set up git-acm, as well as how to use it effectively in your projects.

written in rust ðŸ¦€, btw.
